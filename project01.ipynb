Just in front of the dragon is a plynth, a sort of stone step with an empty slit in the center. It shows signs that it was not there at the time of the dragon's demise, not being drenched in the blood that covers the majority of the rest of the room. The plynth now stands empty of the sword once sheathed within it. Unsuprising. But if they took that sword and they also show the same disregard as before...
